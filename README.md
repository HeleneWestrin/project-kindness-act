# Random Acts of Kindness

Our mission was to create a landing page for the fictional app Random Acts of Kindness. This was a collaboration with the a UX designer from the UX Bootcamp. The goal was to use Styled Components and also to follow the given design as close as possible. It also meant to practice using Figma Dev Mode and to communicate and collaborate with our UX designer.

## The Project

We started out by setting up the project together using LiveShare. Beforehand we had decided on a folder and component structure, so it was easy to set it all up. After creating all the files we started by adding global CSS and a theme with all our colors, spacings and fonts. We also started to define the typography components.

After our initial setup we created a to-do list in Slack where we assigned ourselves to different tasks. This ensured we knew who worked on what.

We didn't really encounter any big hurdles. It was a quite straight forward project and fun design to implement.

One thing I (Helene), struggled a little bit with in the beginning was the transient props when using Styled Components. I took a while to figure out what was causing the error messages.
